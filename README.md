# End-to-End-Data-Science-Project-Customer-Churn-Prediction-for-a-Subscription-Based-Business


An End-to-End Data Science Project for Customer Churn Prediction for a subscription-based business involves multiple steps that cover the full cycle of a data science project: from data collection and cleaning to model building, evaluation, and deployment. Below is an outline of such a project, including details for each phase.

1. Problem Definition
Goal: Predict whether a customer will churn (leave) a subscription-based business. This allows the business to identify customers who are likely to cancel their subscriptions and take preventive measures (e.g., targeted offers, customer support, etc.).

3. Data Collection
Source: The data for this project could come from various sources such as CRM systems, subscription databases, customer surveys, and more. Typically, it would include information like customer demographics, account usage patterns, customer service interactions, subscription details, and more.
Dataset Example: A customer dataset might contain columns like:
CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
Gender: Customer's gender (e.g., Male/Female)
Age: Age of the customer
Tenure: Duration the customer has been subscribed to the service
Service usage: How frequently or intensively the customer uses the service
Support tickets: Number of complaints or support tickets raised by the customer
Churn: Binary outcome variable (1 for churn, 0 for non-churn)

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective: Understand the data, its structure, and relationships between variables. Visualizations and statistical analysis are performed to uncover insights.

Steps involved:

Data Overview: Display the first few rows of data to understand its structure.
Missing Values: Check for missing or inconsistent data and decide whether to drop or fill these missing values.
Outlier Detection: Identify any extreme values in the dataset that may affect model training.
Correlation Analysis: Check relationships between numerical features (e.g., using heatmaps).
Univariate and Bivariate Analysis: Visualize the distribution of individual features (histograms, box plots) and relationships between target and features (scatter plots, pair plots).
Feature Importance: Analyze which features are most important in predicting churn.

4. Data Cleaning
Handling Missing Data: Use techniques like imputation (mean, median, mode) or remove rows/columns with missing data if applicable.
Handling Categorical Data: Convert categorical variables (e.g., Gender, Subscription Type) into numerical representations using methods like:
One-hot encoding
Label encoding
Scaling and Normalization: Standardize numerical features (e.g., Age, Tenure) using techniques like Min-Max scaling or Standardization to ensure features are on the same scale.

5. Feature Engineering
Feature Creation: You can create new features based on domain knowledge or EDA insights. For instance:
Customer Lifetime: Calculate the customer’s total subscription time.
Average Usage: Compute average service usage if it's available.
Customer Segmentation: Group customers into segments (e.g., high usage, low usage) for more granular insights.
Interaction Features: Create interaction terms between variables that might help in improving prediction accuracy (e.g., Tenure * Monthly Spend).

6. Model Selection and Training
Objective: Train machine learning models to predict customer churn. The process involves:
Splitting Data: Divide the data into training and test sets (e.g., 80-20 or 70-30 split).
Model Selection: Experiment with different machine learning algorithms such as:

Random Forest


Model Evaluation: After training, evaluate the performance of the model using suitable metrics:
Accuracy: Percentage of correctly classified instances.
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: More important in imbalanced classes (i.e., churn vs non-churn).
AUC-ROC Curve: To measure how well the model distinguishes between churn and non-churn.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like Grid Search or Randomized Search to fine-tune the model’s parameters.

7. Model Interpretation
Feature Importance: Analyze which features the model is considering most important for predicting churn.
Shapley Values: Use methods like SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) to interpret the model's decisions and understand the impact of each feature on the final prediction.

9. Model Evaluation on Test Data
After training the model, it's crucial to evaluate its performance on a test set that it hasn't seen before.
Ensure the model generalizes well to new, unseen data and avoids overfitting to the training set.

11. Model Deployment
Create a Flask API: For real-time predictions, deploy the model as a web service using Flask (as shown in the previous answers). Users can send POST requests with new customer data to get a churn prediction.
